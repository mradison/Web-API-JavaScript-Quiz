# Web-API-JavaScript-Quiz

I created this JavaScript Quiz from scratch so that the user can practice their skills to see how well they know a couple of software languages

## Instructions

Click on the "Start Quiz" button and then make your best guesses on the answer to each question.

Be careful because if you get a wrong answer it deducts your time and score by 10 points/seconds.

## User Story

AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

## Acceptance Criteria 

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score

## Mock-Up

Here is a link to a screenshot of what the quiz looks like and my repository and live pages:
